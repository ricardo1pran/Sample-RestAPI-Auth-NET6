# Sample RestAPI with Authentication header using .NET 6.0
Sample RestAPI Project for your starter code or for learning.

## Details
This project is written in .NET 6.0 using Visual Studio 2022. This project originally for practice purposes, as I'm usually using .NET Core 3.3 or .NET 5, and wanted to know what's different in .NET 6.0.

### Project Features
This section and more sections after it will be updated soon, as I'm still tidying my Github repositories.
